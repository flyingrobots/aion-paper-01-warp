## Overview

This repository contains the LaTeX source, figures, and compiled PDF for **Paper I** of the *AIΩN Foundations Series*.

This paper introduces **Recursive Metagraphs (RMGs)** — a new graph object built from recursively nested typed open graphs. RMGs form the foundational data structure of the **AIΩN computer**, enabling deterministic multiway computation, holographic provenance, and worldline-level reasoning.

Paper I develops:

- A formal definition of RMGs  
- A categorical treatment via initial algebras  
- Morphisms and recursion principles  
- Relationship to open graphs and hypergraphs  
- The attachment/skeleton decomposition  
- The RMG category  

This is the mathematical base on which Papers II–VI stand.
