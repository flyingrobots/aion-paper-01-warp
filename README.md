## Overview

This repository contains the LaTeX source, figures, and compiled PDF for **Paper I** of the _AIΩN Foundations Series_.

The paper introduces **WARP graphs (Worldline Algebra for Recursive Provenance)** — a recursively defined **graph-of-graphs** object built from finitely nested typed open graphs. WARP graphs serve as the foundational state representation for the AIΩN computer, enabling deterministic multiway computation, holographic provenance, and worldline-level reasoning.

**Paper I establishes the object.**  
Subsequent papers develop semantics, dynamics, and ethical implications on top of this foundation.

Specifically, Paper I develops:

- A formal inductive definition of WARP graphs
- An initial-algebra characterisation
- Morphisms, recursion principles, and depth/unfoldings
- Embeddings of ordinary graphs and hypergraphs
- The attachment / skeleton decomposition
- The category $WARP$

This paper is intended to be the canonical reference for the WARP graph construction.
